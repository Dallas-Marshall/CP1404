Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# Question 1
# A value error will occur when a string is entered into the program.
# Question 2
# A division by zero error will occur when the user enters the value 0 into the denominator
# question 3
# To avoid a division by zero error you could add an error checking loop onto the input for denominator
